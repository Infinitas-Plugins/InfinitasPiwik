[Piwik](http://piwik.org/) is a free downloadable open source web analytics software. Piwik provides you with detailed reports on your website visitors; the search engines and keywords they used, the language they speak, your popular pages, and much more.

The InfinitasPiwik plugin makes integration of the tracking code, along with viewing basic reports from the [admin backend](/admin/infinitas\_piwik) simple. It also provides access to advanced tracking features that can be used for eCommerce tracking in the Shop plugin.
